# Terms of Service (Demo / Test Environment)

## TL;DR (Plain English)

- **This is a demo/test environment**, not a finished product. Things may break, change, or disappear at any time.
- **It’s free** : no subscription fees, no ads, and we’re **not selling your personal data**.
- **Your data is not secure here.** This system can run on permissionless / third-party compute, so **others may see your prompts**. **Don’t enter PII, secrets, or anything sensitive.**
- We use safety filters, but **they’re not perfect** : you might still see incorrect or inappropriate outputs.
- **Don’t use this for adult/explicit content, illegal activity, or anything high-risk.** We can revoke access at any time, and we may cooperate with legal investigations and report illegal use.
- **Use at your own risk.** No warranties. **No liability for damages**, including consequential damages.
- Disputes are handled by **mandatory individual arbitration** (not court), and **no class actions**.


**Last updated:** January 1, 2026

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the Loosh websites, applications, and related services that link to these Terms (collectively, the “**Service**”), provided by Loosh AI, Inc. (“**Loosh**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”).

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.



## 1) What This Is (and Isn’t)

The Service is **expressly a demo and test environment**. It is provided to allow users to explore, evaluate, and experiment with Loosh’s evolving agentic and cognitive systems.

**The Service is not a production system**, is **not intended for mission-critical use**, and may be modified, degraded, interrupted, throttled, or discontinued at any time.



## 2) No Paid Service; No Ads or Data Sales; No “Paying With Your Data”

The Service is currently offered **without charge**. You acknowledge that:

- You are not paying for the Service,
- You are using it voluntarily, and
- **The lack of payment is a material basis** for the disclaimers and limitations in these Terms.

We also provide the Service **without advertising revenue** and **without selling your personal data**. We do not provide this demo as a direct commercial product, and we do not treat your prompts as a product to be sold to other users.

That said, the Service may operate on or interact with **permissionless compute networks** (including networks that provide ecosystem incentives or compensation to participants). If Loosh receives compensation from such a network (e.g., via Bittensor-related incentives), you acknowledge and agree that:

- **Any such compensation is not tied to your individual engagement**, usage volume, or prompts in this demo, and
- It is not a “sale” of your personal data, nor does it change the security reality described in Section 3.



## 3) Data Security and Permissionless / Third-Party Compute (Important)

**The Service is not a secure environment.** While communications may be encrypted in transit, the Service may route or process prompts and outputs through **permissionless or third-party compute** infrastructure.

As a result:

- **Third parties may be exposed to your prompts, inputs, outputs, or related metadata**, and
- Loosh **cannot guarantee confidentiality, retention behavior, deletion, or data handling practices** of third parties.

**Do not submit personal data, sensitive data, confidential information, trade secrets, regulated data, or personally identifiable information (PII).**

You are solely responsible for the content you submit and the consequences of submitting it.



## 4) Eligibility

You must be legally able to enter into these Terms and comply with applicable laws. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent you have authority to bind that organization.



## 5) Acceptable Use (You Agree Not To…)

You agree not to use the Service to:

- Violate any law or regulation;
- Infringe intellectual property or other rights;
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or data;
- Transmit malware or harmful code;
- Engage in abuse, harassment, exploitation, or doxxing;
- Submit content you do not have rights to share;
- Use the Service for **adult, explicit sexual, pornographic, or erotic** purposes;
- Request, generate, distribute, or facilitate **illegal content** or illegal activity;
- Use the Service to harm minors, groom, exploit, or sexualize minors (including any CSAM content);
- Use the Service to facilitate fraud, scams, or identity theft;
- Use the Service to create or distribute content that is intended to incite or enable violence or other wrongdoing.

We may suspend, restrict, or terminate access at any time (see Section 10).



## 6) Content Safety Filters (Not a Guarantee)

We use content safety measures and filters intended to reduce harmful or inappropriate content. **However, you acknowledge and agree that no safety system is perfect**, and we **do not guarantee** that the Service will:

- Detect or block all inappropriate content,
- Prevent exposure to content you may find offensive or harmful, or
- Prevent outputs that are incorrect, unsafe, or otherwise undesirable.

You accept the risk that you may encounter unexpected or objectionable material while using a demo/test environment.



## 7) Beta Features, Rate Limits, and Performance Testing

You acknowledge that **performance, availability, latency, and throughput are part of what we are actively testing**. The Service may impose:

- Rate limits, queueing, throttling, or caps,
- Experimental pipelines that may be slower or less reliable,
- Changes that impact behavior without notice.

This is an intended function of the platform.



## 8) Outputs Are Not Professional Advice; No Reliance

Any outputs are for informational and experimental purposes only and may be incorrect, incomplete, misleading, or unsafe. **Do not rely on outputs** for decisions involving legal, medical, financial, safety, compliance, or other professional contexts.

You are solely responsible for verifying outputs before use.



## 9) Intellectual Property

As between you and Loosh:

- Loosh retains all rights to the Service, software, and underlying technology.
- You retain rights you have in your inputs, subject to the licenses you grant below.

**License to Loosh.** By submitting inputs, you grant Loosh a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, and process your inputs and related outputs:
- to operate and provide the Service,
- to monitor, debug, and improve the Service,
- for quality assurance, evaluation, testing, and **potentially model training or fine-tuning**, including via contractors or service providers.

Because this is a demo/test environment and data may traverse third parties, you understand you may not be able to revoke or fully delete propagated data.



## 10) Termination; Revocation of Access

We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Service **at any time, for any reason or no reason**, with or without notice, and without liability to you.

You acknowledge that, because this is a free demo/test environment, **you have no expectation of continued access**, and **no recourse** for any suspension, restriction, or termination, to the maximum extent permitted by law.



## 11) Cooperation With Investigations; Reporting Illegal Use

You agree not to use the Service for illegal purposes. If we become aware of activity that we reasonably believe violates the law, we may:

- Preserve relevant information (including logs and metadata),
- **Cooperate with law enforcement or legal process**, and
- **Report suspected illegal activity** to appropriate authorities,

in each case as we determine appropriate and as permitted or required by law.



## 12) Third-Party Services and Infrastructure

The Service may depend on third-party platforms, networks, tools, or compute operators. Loosh is not responsible for third-party services, and your use may be subject to third-party terms.



## 13) High-Risk Use Prohibited

You agree not to use the Service for safety-critical, regulated, or high-risk activities, including (non-exhaustive):

- medical diagnosis/treatment,
- emergency response,
- operation of vehicles or machinery where failure could cause harm,
- weapons or surveillance targeting,
- critical infrastructure control,
- decisions affecting legal rights, employment, housing, credit, or insurance.

You assume all risk for any use of the Service.



## 14) DISCLAIMERS (AS-IS / AS-AVAILABLE; NO WARRANTIES)

**THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” FOR DEMONSTRATION AND TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LOOSH DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF:

- MERCHANTABILITY,
- FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
- NON-INFRINGEMENT,
- TITLE,
- ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS,
- SECURITY,
- AVAILABILITY,
- ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION,
- RESULTS OR OUTCOMES,
- SUITABILITY FOR ANY PURPOSE OR USE CASE.

**WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT DATA WILL BE SECURE OR CONFIDENTIAL**, THAT OUTPUTS WILL BE CORRECT, OR THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET ANY REQUIREMENTS.



## 15) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; LIABILITY CAP)

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:

1. **NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.** IN NO EVENT WILL LOOSH BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, **WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE** AND **WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY**, EVEN IF LOOSH HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

2. **NO LIABILITY FOR DATA EXPOSURE VIA PERMISSIONLESS/THIRD-PARTY COMPUTE.** YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY EXPOSURE, RETENTION, OR MISUSE OF DATA BY THIRD-PARTY COMPUTE OPERATORS IS A RISK YOU ASSUME, AND LOOSH DISCLAIMS LIABILITY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

3. **LIABILITY CAP.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LOOSH’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED **USD $0** (OR, IF A COURT DOES NOT PERMIT THAT, THE GREATER OF **$100** OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO LOOSH FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM : WHICH, FOR THIS FREE DEMO, IS EXPECTED TO BE $0).

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in such cases, liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.



## 16) Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Loosh and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to:

- your access to or use of the Service,
- your inputs or use of outputs,
- your violation of these Terms,
- your violation of any law or third-party rights.



## 17) Dispute Resolution: Mandatory Arbitration; Class Action Waiver

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**  
It requires **binding individual arbitration** and includes a **class action waiver**.

### 17.1 Informal Resolution First
Before filing a claim against Loosh, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending written notice to:
- **legal@loosh.ai** (or other address we designate)

Your notice must include: your name, contact information, a description of the dispute, and the relief sought. We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally within **60 days** of receiving notice.

### 17.2 Agreement to Arbitrate
If a dispute is not resolved informally, you and Loosh agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service (a “**Dispute**”) will be resolved by **binding arbitration** on an **individual basis**, except as stated below.

This arbitration agreement is governed by the **Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)**.

### 17.3 Exceptions
Either party may:
- Bring an individual action in **small claims court** if it qualifies, or
- Seek **injunctive or equitable relief** in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property or confidentiality rights.

### 17.4 Arbitration Provider and Rules
Arbitration will be administered by **JAMS** under its applicable rules (including the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules, if applicable), unless the parties agree otherwise.

The arbitrator has authority to award any relief that would otherwise be available in court **to the extent permitted by law**, but only on an **individual** basis.

### 17.5 Location; Remote Proceedings
Arbitration will take place in **Delaware**, unless you and Loosh agree to conduct it by **video, phone, or based solely on written submissions**, which Loosh expects to be appropriate for many disputes.

### 17.6 Fees
Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the JAMS rules and applicable law. If you can’t afford fees, you may seek a fee waiver from JAMS. We may also agree to pay certain fees where required by law.

### 17.7 CLASS ACTION WAIVER
**YOU AND LOOSH AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.**

The arbitrator may not consolidate claims or preside over any form of class or representative proceeding.

### 17.8 Jury Trial Waiver
If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, you and Loosh **waive any right to a jury trial** to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 17.9 Severability
If any portion of this Section 17 is found unenforceable, that portion will be severed, and the remainder will remain in effect:**except** that if the Class Action Waiver is found unenforceable, then this entire Section 17 (arbitration) will be null and void.



## 18) Governing Law; Venue (Non-Arbitration Matters)

These Terms (and any non-arbitrable matters) are governed by the laws of the **State of Delaware**, excluding conflict-of-law rules.

For any dispute not subject to arbitration (including actions to enforce or challenge the arbitration provisions), you and Loosh agree to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in **Delaware**, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.



## 19) Changes to the Service or Terms

We may modify the Service or these Terms at any time. Updated Terms will be posted with a revised “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes means you accept the changes.
